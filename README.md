### Why Open Source

📖
I believe the best way to Learn is by doing.

SwiftUI is evolving and I think it's the future of writing iOS apps.

The true power of SwiftUI, to me, is it's flexibility, thanks to it's vast realm of view modifiers and expressiveness with property wrappers.

You can create an "Hello, World!" app with just a few lines of code (check out the new [@main](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/app/main()>) attribute!) or even, [a calendar view](https://gist.github.com/mecid/f8859ea4bdbd02cf5d440d58e936faec).

SwiftUI give you the most flexible tool an Apple developer could ever ask for, all you need is a bit of creativity, and the [possibilities](https://github.com/Juanpe/About-SwiftUI), [are](https://github.com/chinsyo/awesome-swiftui), [limitless](https://github.com/onmyway133/awesome-swiftui).

Clendar would not be possible without the public knowledge of the community about SwiftUI that I came across often while learning about the technologies and to build the app. To name a few, in no particular order:

-   https://raywenderlich.com
-   https://www.swiftbysundell.com
-   https://www.hackingwithswift.com
-   https://sarunw.com
-   https://github.com/onmyway133/blog/issues
-   https://github.com/topics/swiftui

my notes about SwiftUI:

-   https://github.com/vinhnx/notes/issues/342

By publishing Clendar, I would like to give back to the community. 😊

### Why GPL License?

I want Clendar to be open source but I don't want people to republish the app with a different name on the App Store. Please do not fork this project and submit to the App Store under your own account.

The GPL requires that you give the original developer credit and it also requires that the modified app also be open source. So please don't do this! 🙏🏻

And, if you like, you can purchase the app on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clendar-a-calendar-app/id1548102041?itsct=apps_box&itscg=30200).

Thanks and take care! 🍀
